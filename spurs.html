        <h2 class="subtitle"> Recent developments</h2>
        <p> After Matty Cash's cynical foul on Rodrigo Bentancur, it is confirmed that he has sufferent ankle ligament damage and will be out for 2 months or more. You have to feel for him as he has only just revovered from his serious knee injury. This latest injury spells turmoil for spurs with the list of absentees growing:  </p>

        <ul class="injured">
            <li>Bentancur</li>
            <li>Maddison</li>
            <li>Van de Ven</li>
            <li>Richarlison</li>
            <li>Manor solomon</li>
        </ul>
        <p> and there are many more too. This also wasn't helped by the red cards received in the Chelsea game by :</p>
        <ol class="red">
            <li>Romero-facing a 3 game ban</li>
            <li>Udogie-1 match ban</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Spurs, who were top of the league, have faced three defeats in a row and you have to think it's almost entirely due to the ridiculous number of injuries.
            It is clear spurs lacked depth from the start of the season and having both Van de Ven and Romero out for the last couple games, spurs look nowhere near as confident at the back. The player they miss most is clearly maddison though, who was the heart of all creativity is the side this year. 
            It will be a long end to the year for all spurs fans while they all anxiously wait for his return. Tottenham's next game is against Manchester City away and you have to think the odds are certainly against them at this time, despite spurs somewhat being City's bogey team.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Overrelliance on Son</h2>
        <p>Although slightly off it in his last couple of games, Son has been the man to score goals for spurs this year, netting 8 goals for the lilywhites so far this season.
            However, his teamates are nowhere near as clinical. 
            This is made clear by son creating 7 big chances but only having 1 assist, in comparison with someone like Salah who has 8 big chances created and 5 assists. It is becoming clear, especially after the Maddison injury that there is a lack of clinicality in this team. Do spurs need to invest in January in some sort of Kane replacement?</p>
